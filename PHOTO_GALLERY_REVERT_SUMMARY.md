# Photo Gallery Reverted to Grid Layout

## Summary
The photo gallery has been successfully reverted from the slideshow/carousel format back to the original grid-based layout based on user feedback about the slideshow being too visually dominant.

## Changes Made

### PhotoGallery.tsx
- **Removed slideshow logic**: Eliminated all slideshow-specific state variables (`currentSlideIndex`, auto-advance effects)
- **Simplified imports**: Removed unused `useEffect` import and `t` from `useLanguage`
- **Grid layout**: Replaced slideshow container with a responsive photo grid
- **Hover effects**: Added subtle animations and overlay effects on hover
- **Maintained functionality**: Kept category filtering and lightbox modal features
- **Removed debugging**: Eliminated console logs and "(Slideshow)" label

### index.css
- **Removed slideshow styles**: Eliminated all slideshow-specific CSS classes:
  - `.slideshow-container`, `.slideshow-main`, `.slide-wrapper`
  - `.slide-image`, `.slide-overlay`, `.slide-nav`, `.slide-info`
  - `.thumbnail-strip`, `.thumbnail`, `.dots-indicator`, `.dot`
  - `.expand-button`, `.slide-counter`
- **Added grid styles**: Implemented responsive grid layout:
  - `.photo-grid`: CSS Grid with auto-fit columns (minimum 300px)
  - `.photo-item`: Individual photo containers with hover effects
  - `.grid-image`: Optimized image display with scale-on-hover
  - `.photo-overlay`: Title overlay that slides up on hover
- **Improved typography**: Increased font sizes for better readability
- **Enhanced spacing**: More generous margins and padding throughout
- **Mobile responsive**: Optimized grid for mobile devices (single column on small screens)

### Features Preserved
- ✅ Category filtering dropdown with bilingual support
- ✅ Lightbox modal for full-screen photo viewing
- ✅ Navigation within lightbox (previous/next buttons)
- ✅ Costa Bella images integration
- ✅ Responsive design for all screen sizes
- ✅ Smooth hover animations and transitions

### Features Removed
- ❌ Slideshow auto-advance functionality
- ❌ Thumbnail strip navigation
- ❌ Dot indicators for mobile
- ❌ Single-image prominent display
- ❌ Slide counter and expand button

## Result
The photo gallery now displays as a clean, modern grid that:
- Shows multiple photos at once for better browsing
- Maintains visual consistency with the rest of the property page
- Provides hover effects for interactive feedback
- Preserves all filtering and lightbox functionality
- Uses the user's uploaded Costa Bella images correctly

The grid layout is much less visually dominant while still showcasing the property photos effectively.
